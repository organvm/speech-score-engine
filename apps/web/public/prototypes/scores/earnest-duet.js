// Score: Earnest — a duet (The Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde, public domain).
// FIRST TASTE of L5: a human actor performing with an AI actor, simultaneously. ALGERNON is voiced
// by the engine (performer:'ai'); JACK is a live lane (performer:'human') — the engine holds it
// silent and marks it, so a real actor speaks Jack's lines into the gaps while the AI keeps the beat.
